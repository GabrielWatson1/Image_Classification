# Image_Classification
Image Classification with CNN

❗❗❗❗DISCLAIMER❗❗❗❗ - 
THIS PROJECT IS NOT ORIGINAL. A lot of that project is taken from kaggle and other platforms. The point of this project was not to show what I know but to understand how Image classification worked. I do however, post everything Git as I find it important as a means to keep track of my progress but also which areas I am intrested in. 


This project I would like to look more into deep learning and apply the deep learning framework TensorFlow to do Image Classification of a dataset. Most of the examples on Kaggle use CNN(Convolutional neural networks, so In an AIM to learn more about CNN I will use other projects as a framwork
The reson for this specific topic is that I have an intrest in areas such as self driving cars, A.I and in general the ability for computers to determin the difference between certain things. 

As the data was too large to add as a file on Git I will simply add the link to kaggle where I got the data from
